# WebExecutionSITAC

This repository contains a web application that supports the execution of service compositions. These compositions
are defined as business processes according to the BPMN 2.0 standard. The graphical user interfaces that allow the
user to invoke the web services are generated dynamically during the process execution.

[Activiti](http://activiti.org/) is the core technology of the web application. BPMN 2.0 process models follow the syntax
of the Activiti Designer and these processes are executed by means of the Activiti Engine.

The web application was developed in the context of an ITEA 3 project: [SITAC](https://itea3.org/project/sitac.html).
